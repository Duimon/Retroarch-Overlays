## Instructions

First you need to load one of HSM's shaders and create either a game or core preset. Then use the night version graphics as the background in the shader. (By manually editing the background image path in the preset *.slangp.)

I have all my graphics in an "images" folder in the root of my Retroarch folder to make it easier to get to them.

Then using the shader parameters.

- Set the bezel and frame to 0% opacity. 

- Tweak the 2D curvature (I haven't tried the 3D) and Non-Integer scale. (It should be really easy to do)

- Finally you need to fine tune the bezel height and width to tweak where the reflection falls. (This is easiest to do by playing a game until there is a good amount of reflection going on) (I also have the retroarch UI  background opacity turned down by default so I can see the game better during parameter adjustments)

- Ideally you also need to set the bezel color value to match as well as you can but the default dark color should work if you are not fussy)

HSM an I have been talking some more and this may get far easier to do in the near future. :wink:

When the shader eventually hits the repo I will be releasing presets for all my HSM graphics. (For just the HSM Dr. Venom shader. :upside_down_face: I may do a poll to decide which shader to use.)
